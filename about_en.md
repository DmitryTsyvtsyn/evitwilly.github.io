### Story about me (<a href="/about" style="color: #0085A1">Русский</a>)

I decided to get serious about programming in 2018.

It was a hot summer and I liked going to the field and jogging there.

Java was my first language (in fact, I wrote the first code back in the 7th grade in **C++**)

I started learning Java with a thick book **Herbert Schildt** of 1500 pages!.

I could't concentrate properly and it was very difficult for me to read it.

December 31, 2018 I wrote my first Kyzer project.

*Kyzer determined matrix determinants, could add, subtract and multiply them. It was a graphical application in JavaFX, the source code of which I could not find unfortunately.*

At the beginning of 2019, I became interested in **Python and machine learning**, read one book and made a neural network that determined handwritten numbers.

Then I got interested in Kivy (a library that allows you to create graphical applications in Python) and started learning the **VK API**.

I made a cool app that asked for a phone number and password from VK, then provided several options:

- remove all friends
- remove all photos from the page
- remove communities and groups

I also developed a VK bot that gave out random quotes according to the author.

In September 2019, I became interested in **C/C++ and algorithms**.

I implemented various data structures (stack, queue, linked list), worked with memory and got acquainted with the features of C ++.

Sometime in March 2020, I made a graphical application in **Java** that saved user passwords with light and dark themes.

Then I was asked to make an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.rubt.rubttimetable&hl=ru&gl=US" style="color: #0085A1">app for my college </a> to view the class schedule.

That's how I met **Android**.

At first I watched YouTube and repeated.

Then I started reading <a href="https://developer.android.com" style="color: #0085A1">developer.android.com</a> + articles from the web and of course <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overlow</a>

In the fall of 2020, I enabled notifications for my application and rewrote it from Java to Kotlin.

In January 2021, I got a job as a mobile developer at Unique Journey LLC (location: Russia, Sochi) and worked for a year.

There was no native development, but there was **Flutter**, which I liked at first, and then I began to hate it.

During the year I made three projects: Ecotrails, visit-sochi and Krasnaya Polyana.

In January 2022, I started interviewing for different companies and ended up at **SBERBANK**.

In addition to my permanent job, I borrowed a project from a friend from Ufa: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.freeit.dumrb" style="color: #0085A1" >DUM RB</a> and actively support it.
I also spend time on **open source** code, and if you're interested, take a look at three of my projects:

- <a href="https://github.com/evitwilly/Kotlin-Algorithms-and-Design-Patterns" style="color: #0085A1">Kotlin Algorithms and Design Patterns</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/evitwilly/locsimple" style="color: #0085A1">locsimple</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/evitwilly/kotui" style="color: #0085A1">kotui</a>

To be continued...
